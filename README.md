=========

Basic framework for writing a C wrapper around the Valve Steam API.
At the moment, it's a readily accessible storage of the C wrapping code
written (but no longer used) by SteamBridge.  As there were more or
less ripped directly from SteamBridge (a Winelib project), it'll take
some elbow grease to get it working - but it's much of the grunt work
of generating names for each function call.
